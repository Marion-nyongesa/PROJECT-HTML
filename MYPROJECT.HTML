  <p>Wangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmental and political activist. She founded the Green Belt Movement, a grassroots organization focused on the planting of trees, environmental conservation, and women's rights. In 2004, she became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
    Maathai was born in Nyeri, Kenya, in 1940. She was the first woman in her family to go to school, and she went on to earn a PhD in biology from the University of Pittsburgh. After returning to Kenya, she became a professor of veterinary anatomy at the University of Nairobi.
